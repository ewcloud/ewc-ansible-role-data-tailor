# Data Tailor Ansible Role

This repository contains a configuration template 
(i.e. an [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)) 
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).
The template is designed to:
* Configure pre-existing virtual machines such that they:
  * Are able to run [EUMETSAT Data Tailor standalone](https://user.eumetsat.int/resources/user-guides/data-tailor-standalone-guide) and [EUMETSAT Data Access
  Client (EUMDAC)](https://pypi.org/project/eumdac/).

## Usage

The step-by-step described below assume your local file system follows the 
example structure below, with `ewc-ansible-role-data-tailor` being a clone of this
repository:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ roles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ewc-ansible-role-data-tailor
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory.yml
â””â”€â”€ playbook.yml
```

### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:
```yaml
# inventory.yml
---
ewcloud:
  hosts:
    data_tailor:
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
      ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH RSA private key file>
      ansible_user: <add the username which owns the SSH RSA private key >
```
### 2. Customize the template

Edit input values for the template [variables](./vars/main.yml) as needed (see
[Inputs](#inputs) section for details).
Then, proceed to create an Ansible Playbook file to load your customizations: 

```yaml
# playbook.yml
---
- name: Data Tailor Library Item Automation Script 
  hosts: data_tailor
  become: true
  become_user: root
  become_method: ansible.builtin.sudo

  roles:
    - ewc-ansible-role-data-tailor
```

### 3. Apply the template

You can apply changes on the target host by running:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```
